# Woofer

## Description
Woofer is a social media app aimed to bring animal lovers together. It presents the user with options of accepting or rejecting another based on their profile information. When both users match they can start a conversation and take their friendship from there. This project was made for CP317 - Software Engineering class.



## Features
-  Authentication using Firebase
-  Live chat system for users who have accepted each other
-  Save user profile and image to Firebase
-  Used React Router to navigate between pages



## Installation

To get started with running a local version you will need to clone this repository. After you will need to create your own Firebase application and setup your config in the `src/api/api.js`. 



## Usage

Make your own account by filling in an email and password and click sign up.
Fill in your profile information, and click submit.
You can then accept and reject users, message accepted users and change ur profile settings by navigating between the pages on the bottom.
