# Woofer
Woofer is a social media app aimed to bring animal lovers together. It presents the user with options of accepting or rejecting another user and only gives them a picture and basic information about the other person. When both users match they can start a conversation and take their friendship from there! 

This project implemented the matching functionallity and a live chat for users. We didnt implement services or date scheduling between users. This project requires npm to be installed to start the frontend. The backend and database is always live thanks to Firebase.
